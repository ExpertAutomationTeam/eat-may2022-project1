in java everything has to be within a class
main method is the starting point of any program
print statement displays anything in the console
in java we can use // for single line comment or /**/ for multiple lines comment
any statement has to finish with (;) except block {}
naming in java:
    - names can contain letters, digits, underscores, dollars sign
    - must start with lower case letter or underscore or dollars sign
    - no white spacing
    - cannot use any java keyword
    - use camel case (ex: exampleOfCamelCase)
a non-primitive variable is a powerful variable that can be manipulated
while loop checks the condition first then executes the code
do while loop executes the code then checks the condition
java is all about classes and objects
a java class is a blueprint
method: is a reusable block of code that is working only when called
in java object is instance of a class
object or instance of a class inherits all the class properties
java is hardly typed language
modifiers:
    - access modifiers: public / private / default / protected
    - non-access modifiers: final / static / abstract
non-static method can use both static and non-static variables
static method cam use only static variables
non-static properties belong to the object
static properties belong to the class

git commands:
git init
git remote add origin <url>
git add .
git commit -m "message"
git push -u origin master

oops:
    - encapsulation: data hiding (variables)
    - inheritance: attribute inheritance from a class to another (classes)
    - polymorphism: method overloading and method overriding (methods)
    - abstraction: implementation hiding (road map)

final keyword:
    - final variable cannot be reassigned
    - final class cannot be inherited

abstract keyword:
    - abstract keyword makes a class hybrid interface/class
    - abstract keyword makes methods abstract (they cannot be implemented)
